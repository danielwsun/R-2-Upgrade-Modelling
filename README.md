# R-2-Upgrade-Modelling
Due to organisation mergence, this project github site has been moved to https://github.csiro.au/sun050/R-2-Upgrade-Modelling/

The files include the R code of the Markov models and the script code for controlling R^2 on AWS. The model can be run in any R environment.

The soure code of a simple R^2 can be retrieved in https://github.csiro.au/abtran/asgard,(which, however, may not be reached outside CSIRO, if necessary contact).

Any questions and requests should be sent to daniel.sun@data61.csiro.au
